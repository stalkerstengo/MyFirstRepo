Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Aya, and I’m currently a student who’s really focused on improving myself and building a strong future. I enjoy learning new skills, especially anything related to design, writing, and personal development.
I’m working on becoming more disciplined and pushing myself toward my long-term goals, including studying abroad and building a meaningful career. This repository is part of my journey as I grow, learn, and level up.
